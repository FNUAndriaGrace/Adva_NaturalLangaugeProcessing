    "\n",
    "When you run the LSTM sentiment classifier in `Assignment_1_LSTM_tutorial` you'll note that this classifier has a test accuracy of `0.0`. Why might that be? Hint: take a look at the original dataset and note how the train, test, and validation datasets have been generated.  Examine the distribution of labels in each dataset."

    "### Imbalanced Dataset:\n",
    "The original dataset used for training has a significant imbalance between positive and negative labels, the model may learn to predict only the majority class. For instance, if 90% of the training samples are positive, the model might predict all test samples as positive, resulting in poor accuracy on the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Incorrect Splitting of Data:\n",
    "The train, test, and validation datasets are generated in such a way that they do not represent the overall distribution of labels accurately, the model may not generalize well. For example, if all positive samples are in the training set and all negative samples are in the test set, the model will achieve high accuracy on the training set but will perform poorly on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Leakage:\n",
    "There is a leakage between the datasets (e.g., if the same samples or very similar samples are present in both the training and testing datasets), this could lead to misleading results. The model may perform well on the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overfitting:\n",
    "The model is overfitting to the training data (especially if the training set is small), it may not perform well on the test set, particularly if the test set includes samples that differ from the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Incorrect Label Encoding:\n",
    "There are issues with how the labels are encoded (e.g., mislabeling or errors in the mapping), the model could misinterpret the classes, leading to incorrect predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Diagnose the Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check the distribution of the labels in the training, validation, and test datasets. Use pandas to visualize the counts of each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check Data Splitting Logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Evaluate Model Performance on Train Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Test accuracy of 0.0 indicates a significant issue in either the dataset or the model training process. By closely examining the data distribution and splitting, you can identify the root cause of the problem and take appropriate corrective actions."
